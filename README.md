This app is used to learn English Words and based on Hibernate ORM, here I used PostgreSQL and to run this application you have to do some configuration first;

Project in work(Special for NFactorial): https://youtu.be/7g05JoWMQps

1) Install pgAdmin by this tutor 
    Windows : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpqJzWCcQXY&t=336s
    Mac OS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy-42clnbmc

2) In pgAdmin create a DB;

3) Go to the file src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml

4) In the hibernate.cfg.xml file update properties:
    hibernate.connection.url;
    hibernate.connection.username;
    hibernate.connection.password;

5) Make sure that your IDE downloaded all External Libraries from POM.xml file;

6) And after that you can easily run the main method and enjoy from learning English =)
